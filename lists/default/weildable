made by [personName]
made in [placeName]
stolen by [personName], who used it to slay [personName]
which glows in the presence of [family]'s children
whose every strike produces a shockwave
which lights aflame when [activated]
whose touch is a jolt of lightning
which contains the trapped souls of its every victim
about-which-no-sound-travels
that is half the average weight
which turns into [weildable] when [activated]
which never loses its edge
which fights of its own accord
which is the bane of all [race]s
which cannot be moved once [activated]
which cannot harm a [race]
which thirsts for blood and screams when wet
which turns into a [animal] when [activated]
whose wielders are cursed [curse]

to hunger for the flesh of [race]
to fear [geologicalFormation]s
to hear the voice of long-dead [person]
