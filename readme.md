# List-Based Generation of Plausible Phrases
*The key elements in human thinking are not numbers but labels of fuzzy sets. -- L. Zadeh*

Immeasurably inspired by [RandListGen](http://www.path-o-logic.com/misc/RandListGen_sample.html).

## Try It!

To generate a phrase from the root -- currently an NPC or location description:
`$ ./generate.sh`


## Todo

* FIT ~ ./generate.sh should take optional listname arguments, or [pattern] phrases.
* FIT ~ ./generate.sh should take optional source lists directory
* FIT ~ optional source directory should selectively overwrite, not wholly replace, main ./lists
* FIT ~ take list name from file name so we don't have to keep them in sync manually
* FIT ~ put newlines in between concatenated lists in root.list
* FIT ~ turn script into utility
* FIT ~ optionally autocopy results to clipboard
