# List-Based Generation of Plausible Phrases

## Try It!

To generate a phrase from the root -- currently an NPC or location description:
`$ ./generate.sh`


## What's Going On?

Immeasurably inspired by [RandListGen](http://www.path-o-logic.com/misc/RandListGen_sample.html).


## Todo

* Fit: Concatenate lists in a /lists dir on generate, so that lists can be maintained seperately.
* Fix: listerpolation should actually work.
* Fit: ./generate.sh should take listname arguments, or [pattern] phrases.
